# Pyth Network Solana SDK

This crate provides utilities for reading price feeds from the [pyth.network](https://pyth.network/) oracle on the Solana network.
It also includes several [off-chain example programs](examples/).

## Installation

Add a dependency to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
pyth-sdk-solana="<version>"
```

See [pyth-sdk-solana on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/pyth-sdk-solana/) to get the latest version of the library.

## Usage

### Price Feeds

Pyth Network stores the data for it's price feeds in Solana accounts, called "price accounts".

Applications can obtain the content of these accounts in two different ways:
* On-chain programs should pass these accounts to the instructions that require price feeds.
* Off-chain programs can access these accounts using the Solana RPC client (as in the [eth price example program](examples/eth_price.rs)).

To use the SDK, you will need to find the price feed account for the symbol you wish to consume. The [Pyth Network documentation](https://docs.pyth.network/consume-data/solana#price-feeds) explains how to do this. The public key of this account corresponds to the ID of the price feed.

### On-chain

On-chain applications should pass the relevant Pyth Network price account to the Solana instruction that consumes it.
This price account will be represented as an `AccountInfo` in the code for the Solana instruction.
The `load_price_feed_from_account_info` function will construct a `PriceFeed` struct from `AccountInfo`:

```rust
use pyth_sdk_solana::{load_price_feed_from_account_info, PriceFeed};

let price_account_info: AccountInfo = ...;
let price_feed: PriceFeed = load_price_feed_from_account_info( &price_account_info ).unwrap();
let current_price: Price = price_feed.get_current_price().unwrap();
println!("price: ({} +- {}) x 10^{}", current_price.price, current_price.conf, current_price.expo);
```

The `PriceFeed` object returned by `load_price_feed_from_account_info` contains all currently-available pricing information about the product.
This struct also has some useful functions for manipulating and combining prices; see the [common SDK documentation](../pyth-sdk) for more details.

Note that your application should also validate the address of the passed-in price account before using it.
Otherwise, an attacker could pass in a different account and set the price to an arbitrary value.

### Off-chain

Off-chain applications can read the current value of a Pyth Network price account using the Solana RPC client.
This client will return the content of the account as an `Account` struct.
The `load_price_feed_from_account` function will construct a `PriceFeed` struct from `Account`:

```rust
use pyth_sdk_solana::{load_price_feed_from_account, PriceFeed};

let price_key: Pubkey = ...;
let mut price_account: Account = ...;
let price_feed: PriceFeed = load_price_feed_from_account( &price_key, &mut price_account ).unwrap();
let current_price: Price = price_feed.get_current_price().unwrap();
println!("price: ({} +- {}) x 10^{}", current_price.price, current_price.conf, current_price.expo);
```

## Off-chain Example Program

The example [eth_price](examples/eth_price.rs) program prints the product reference data and current price information for Pyth on pythnet. You can use the same example and replace the url with the relevant Solana cluster urls to get the same information for Solana clusters.
Run the following commands to try this example program:

```
cargo build --examples
cargo run --example eth_price
```

The output of this command is price of ETH/USD over time, such as:

```
.....ETH/USD.....
status .......... Trading
num_publishers .. 19
price ........... 291958500000 x 10^-8
conf ............ 163920000 x 10^-8
ema_price ....... 291343470000 x 10^-8
ema_conf ........ 98874533 x 10^-8
```

## Development

This library can be built for either your native platform or in BPF (used by Solana programs).
Use `cargo build` / `cargo test` to build and test natively.
Use `cargo build-bpf` / `cargo test-bpf` to build in BPF for Solana; these commands require you to have installed the [Solana CLI tools](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools).
